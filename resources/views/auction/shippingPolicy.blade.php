                        <p>At Prime Auctions, shipping arrangements vary depending on the item purchased. We strive to offer flexible options to suit our customers' needs.</p>

                        <h4>1. Collection or Delivery Options</h4>
                        <p><strong>Collection:</strong> Customers are welcome to collect their items free of charge from our designated location. Collection appointments can be arranged via phone or email.</p>
                        <p><strong>Shipping:</strong> For those who prefer delivery, we offer shipping at an additional cost. The exact shipping fees will depend on the size, weight, and destination of the item.</p>

                        <h4>2. Shipping Arrangements</h4>
                        <p>Once your order is placed, a member of our team will contact you via phone or email to discuss and finalise the best shipping or collection option. Shipping costs will be negotiated during this process to ensure you receive the most suitable and cost-effective method.</p>

                        <h4>3. Confirmation</h4>
                        <p>All shipping and collection arrangements will be confirmed by phone or email once agreed upon. We aim to ensure that your items are delivered or ready for collection in a timely and convenient manner.</p>
